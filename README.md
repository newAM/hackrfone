# HackRF One

This is a rust API for the [HackRF One] software defined radio.

This is not a wrapper around `libhackrf`, this is a re-implementation of
`libhackrf` in rust, using the [rusb] `libusb` wrappers.

This is currently in an *experimental* state, and it is incomplete.
For full feature support use the official `libhackrf` C library.

This is tested only on Linux, but it will likely work on other platforms where
`libhackrf` works.
